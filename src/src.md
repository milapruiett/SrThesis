## Source contains all of the .R files

### What to run for each analysis
- Are there fewer conifer germinants? fewerConG.R
- Are there fewer conifer seeds? tidySeeds.R
- Are there fewer logs? fewerLogs.R
- Do the number of canopy trees match the seed rain? canSeeds.R
(note that you need the csvs created by decidProjectIncomplete.R
and by tidySeeds.R)
- Do the number of con germinants match the nurse log surface area? logGerms.R
(note that you need the csvs created from fewerLogs.R and fewerConG.R)

### If I have time, I will examine the community composition
- the nmds is in nmdsIncomplete.R
- other ways of looking at con vs morph in decidProjectIncomplete.R

### I think these files are garbage, but am worried about deleting them
- thesis1.R
- CleanThesis.R
