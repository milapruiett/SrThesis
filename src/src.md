## Source contains all of the .R files

### What to run for each analysis
- Are there fewer conifer germinants? fewerConG.R
- Are there fewer conifer seeds? tidySeeds.R
- Are there fewer logs? fewerLogs.R
- Do the number of canopy trees match the seed rain? canSeeds.R
(note that you need the csvs created by decidProjectIncomplete.R
and by tidySeeds.R)
- Does the canopy species composition vary by status? nmdsADONIS.R
- Visualization for the canopy sp composition. canopySpp.R
- Creating tidySpp file. makingTidySppCSV.R
- Random stuff. tidySpp.R

### If I have time, I will examine the community composition
- other ways of looking at con vs morph in decidProjectIncomplete.R
